import { Link } from 'gatsby';

The Apollo Router is a high-performance alternative to the Apollo Gateway, written in the Rust programming language.  Apollo Router offers the same general functionality and feature set as the Apollo Gateway, though the manner in which it is configured is different.

The standard Apollo Router packaging is a static binary that is passed its configuration file at start time, rather than a JavaScript application used as a library.  Its configuration file is hot-reloaded, making it possible to change the behavior of a running server with no downtime.  Rather than writing configuration as JavaScript or TypeScript code, the Apollo Router's configuration is provided as a YAML file and supplied to the Router using an argument.

It is possible to use the Apollo Router as a library, but the Apollo Router aims to make it less necessary to write custom user-code, as is done in the Gateway, and instead integrate the most common critical features directly using declarative methods.

## Taking inventory of Gateway configuration

Apollo Gateway runs on top of Apollo Server, and both have various surfaces on which configurations can be made.  To migrate from the Apollo Gateway, you'll need to take account of these configuration and customizations, and implement the same behavior using different mechanisms provided by the Apollo Router.  For example, you may be customizing the HTTP headers that your subgraphs receive from the client, or passing specific headers back to the client from specific subgraphs.

Since Apollo Router is a new product in a new language with different customization techniques, it'll be good to make a check-list of existing configurations to ensure that you capture the differences in your migration.

You'll want to start by looking for configuration and customizations in these places:

- Environment variables
- Non-Apollo telemetry and instrumentation (i.e., OpenTelemetry, Datadog)
- Constructor options passed to `new ApolloGateway({ ... })`
- Constructor options (including plugins) passed to `new ApolloServer({ ... })`
- Specific `plugins` passed to `new ApolloServer({ plugins: [ ... ] })`
- Custom middleware (e.g., Express, Koa, Fastify)

The sections below provide more details on what to look for in each of these categories.

### Environment variables

Environment variables have implicit effect on some Apollo features, like Managed Federation and usage reporting.  Take note of any `APOLLO_` prefixed environment variables that are being set when starting the host runtime you run your Apollo Gateway and Apollo Server on.  All official Apollo-related environment variables are prefixed with `APOLLO_`.

The Apollo Router supports most (non-deprecated) `APOLLO_`-prefixed environment variables, including:

- `APOLLO_KEY`
- `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF`

Again, deprecated environment variables (e.g., `ENGINE_API_KEY`) are *not* supported.  Additionally, the Apollo Router does not currently respect the [`APOLLO_SCHEMA_CONFIG_DELIVERY_ENDPOINT`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/managed-federation/uplink/#environment-variable) variable.  If you require this functionality, please follow and vote on [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/692).

## Constructor options passed to `new ApolloGateway({ ... })`

The amount of customizations you'll find on the `new ApolloGateway({ ... })` constructor options varies, depending on whether you're using managed federation (often indicated by the absence of `supergraphSdl` or `serviceList`), or whether you need to make specific overrides for subgraphs (e.g., by modifying specific services via `buildService`)

### `supergraphSdl`

Generally speaking, the free Apollo managed federation features can be used as the source of truth for Apollo Router, needing only to have the `APOLLO_KEY` environment specified.

When starting, the Apollo Router takes a `--supergraph` argument that specifies the supergraph file that the Router should use.  This file is watched and the Router's supergraph will hot-reload when the file contents are changed.  Any external process can be used to update the Supergraph, though the most common is `rover supergraph compose`, as [seen in our documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/supergraphs/) when not already using Managed Federation.

### `serviceList`

This method of doing in-process composition was deprecated with the introduction of `supergraphSdl`.  Today, [`rover supergraph compose`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/supergraphs/) can process subgraphs from combination of introspection, SDL files and even Studio-registered variants and turn them into a supergraph.  The supergraph can be passed to the Router using the `--supergraph` argument, and is hot-reloaded on each change.

### `buildService`

TODO

- This is often used to override subgraph URLs at runtime.  Now you can use [`override_subgraph_urls`](./configuration/override-subgraph-urls.mdx).

- This function can return `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` classes which allow changing requests to subgraphs
  These are often used to change headers that are passed to subgraphs.  This can be done with `headers`.
  - `willSendRequest`
  - `didReceiveResponse`
  - `didEncounterError`

### `logger`

The passing of the `logger` option enabled the graph operator to specify a different logger for messages that were produced by the Apollo Gateway.  By default, it inherits from the `logger` on Apollo Server.  This was also useful in order to change the verbosity of logging.

In the Apollo Router, logging is JSON-structured in production environments by default and the verbosity can be adjusted.  More advanced logging can be enabled through the use of Plugins (discussed later in this article).  For more information on the built-in logging, see our section on [Logging](./configuration/logging).

## Constructor options (including plugins) passed to `new ApolloServer({ ... })`

There are a large variety of uncommon parameters that can be passed to `new ApolloServer({ ... })`, though we'll focus on the most common ones:

- `context`
- `plugins`

To see the full list of options, see [`ApolloServer` options](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/apollo-server#options).  If you're using other options, additional migration steps may be necessary to replicate the same behavior.  Please open a discussion on our GitHub repository so we can better understand your needs and hopefully help you with a solution.

### `context`

The `context` parameter is an object that is which TODO

### `plugins`

It was often necessary to write various plugins for Apollo Server, which is the foundation that Apollo Gateway runs on.  These plugins are passed to the `new ApolloServer({ ... })` constructor options in the `plugins` array.  First, take note of each plugin and its use-cases and add it to your check-list, then consider approaches to accomplish the same thing in the Apollo Router.  Plugins might not map one-to-one to plugins in the Apollo Router, but you'll find similar techniques..

Generally speaking, Apollo Router is trying to minimize the number of cases where custom plugins are necessary to perform common behaviors. For example, setting custom HTTP status codes, transmitting telemetry data, etc.  To facilitate this, Apollo Router has a YAML-structured configuration that enables common behaviors:

- Propagating particular/all headers to subgraphs
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation and distributed tracing support
- Adjusting logging verbosity

Prior to re-implementing existing Apollo Gateway plugin behavior in a new language (Rust), we encourage our community to start (or engage on existing) conversations about desired customizations in the [GitHub Discussions on the Router repository](https://github.com/apollographql/router/discussions/).  There are various core plugins we think the Apollo Router could offer out of the box, and we'd like help to discuss their design.

For less common use-cases, we also want to help build an ecosystem of plugins that can exist for Apollo Router, allowing users to enable more custom behaviors and to be able to ship the functionality they need before native support is available.

Apollo Router enables a variety of customizations to built through its request-pipeline plugins.  Today all of its plugins are written in Rust.  In the future, we expect to offer the ability to enable functionality in other languages, in the supergraph itself, or by communicating with services alongside the Router (e.g., gRPC, etc).

To facilitate writing Rust plugins, we've put together a series of examples of common plugins and those can be found in the [Customizations](./customizations/overview) documentation.   There we talk about the integration-points of the request-pipeline which can be customized, the types of plugins which can be written, and also offer examples of how they can be used.

If you don't find the migration answers you need in our documentation, we'd love to know.  Please search for existing [Discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql/router/discussions/) and start a new discussion if you don't find what you're looking for.
