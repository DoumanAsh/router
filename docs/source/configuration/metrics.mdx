## Using Prometheus to collect metrics

You can use [Prometheus and Grafana](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/) to collect metrics and visualize the router metrics.

```yaml title="router.yaml"
telemetry:
  metrics:
    prometheus:
      # By setting this endpoint you enable the prometheus exporter
      # All our endpoints exposed by plugins are namespaced by the name of the plugin
      # Then to access to this prometheus endpoint, the full url path will be `/plugins/apollo.telemetry/prometheus`
      enabled: true
```
